# hare-htmpl â€“ A simple HTML templating engine

This is a portable fork of the HTML templating engine used in
[Got](https://got.gameoftrees.org/?action=summary&path=got.git)
and described in
[Omar Polo's blog post](https://www.omarpolo.com/post/template.html).

The `htmplgen` program generates a Hare file from the template file.

The `htmpl` module provides auxiliary functions used by the generated Hare
code, and must be installed for the generated code to compile.

## Dependencies

- [Hare](https://harelang.org)
- A POSIX-compatible Yacc implementation, such as
  [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
- A C compiler
