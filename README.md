# hare-htmpl â€“ A simple HTML templating engine

This is a portable fork of the HTML templating engine used in
[Got](https://got.gameoftrees.org/?action=summary&path=got.git)
and described in
[Omar Polo's blog post](https://www.omarpolo.com/post/template.html).

Currently it's just the C version, I'm going to port it to hare sometime.
The Hare version will live in this repo.
