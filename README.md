# hare-htmpl â€“ A simple HTML templating engine

This is a Hare port of the HTML templating engine used in
[Got](https://got.gameoftrees.org/?action=summary&path=got.git)
and described in
[Omar Polo's blog post](https://www.omarpolo.com/post/template.html).

The `htmplgen` program generates a Hare file from the template file.

The `htmpl` module provides auxiliary functions used by the generated Hare
code, and must be installed for the generated code to compile.

Each template is presented as a function that accepts an `io::handle` and
other user-defined parameters, if any. The template writes to that
`io::handle`; this allows for a variety of output backends (i.e. you
could use a `memio`/`bufio` stream, or write to an actual
file/socket/pipe socket, etc.)
